 375.278 Error AppManagerStates.cpp:1590: Unknown custom-input name: adjust-inserter-pickup
stack traceback:
    [C]: in function 'on_event'
    ...plinterfishing__/prototypes/scripts/fishing-inserter.lua:407: in main chunk
    [C]: in function 'require'
    __modmashsplinterfishing__/control.lua:4: in main chunk

    There may not be one. One solution:
    pcall(function()
        script.on_event("adjust-inserter-pickup",local_inserter_adjust) -- only aplicable if there is the event defined in logistics
    end)
The bug is because I have Allow Inserter Adjustments disabled and the game doesn't like registering to a non-existent event
Another solution is instead of not defining the input, don't listen for the event in the logistics mod. That way at least it's still defined (but has no noticeable impact)
