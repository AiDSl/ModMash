No way to add localized names for unknown modifiers
needs to folllow pattern in local [modifier-description] where ####-##### is the entity name
hero-turret-1-for-####-#####-attack-bonus=#### ##### damage: +__1__

not a bug, generally turrets do not rememebr kill count?
you can update all items mine replica items-with-tags but that just cases a massive issue with inventory

tod work out metric for better scaling
